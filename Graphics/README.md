Guide for next generations.

I was lazy to create smth great and user-friendly in appearence, so be confident to contribute!

1) Press "Vertices" and paint points by pressing on canvas

2) Press "Edges" if it is avaible and paint edges: press on source vertex, press on target vertex - the edge is created! ATTENTION! Loop edge validation is implememnted not in every project!..

3) Press "OK" - data structures are created

4) In 2nd Lab choose the location method (Strips or Chains), press "Locate" and paint points. The result is shown in console ^_^ 

I would be very pleased if you help to remove some defects from this projects, as the subject is rather new, so it won't be removed in nearest time.
